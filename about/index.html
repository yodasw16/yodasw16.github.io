            <h1>Hi, I’m Dave!</h1>
            <p class="hearts">My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/yodasw16">Dave Gillhespy</a>. I am the <i>Director of Design Systems</i> at Rocket Mortgage, but my title doesn't really matter. What matters is that I absolutely love Design Systems and leading people and strategy. It's way more than just a job for me. I am enamored by responsive design, accessibility, and user experience. I dabble in javascript and try to be a designer, but HTML and CSS are my true loves.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I love <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/yodasw16" title="Spotify">music</a> and I love <a href="http://letterboxd.com/yodasw16/" title="Letterboxd">film</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="tools">Tools of the Trade</h2>
            <p>The most important tools that I use are Responsive Design, Sass, JavaScript (with some React and Angular). Additionally, I never stop fighting for the old standbys: user experience, accessibility, performance, and semantic markup.</p>
