I have been trying to catch up with Oscar nominated films so I’m prepared for tonights show. I pretty much managed to watch everything important that I hadn’t seen. So here are my mini Oscar reviews, part 2.

### Avatar

I really didn’t know what to expect with this because of all of the hype, but Avatar absolutely lived up to everything I heard about it. I agree with most that the story is nothing new. It is pretty typical SciFi. It’s the effects that completely blew me away. It took me a while to really become absorbed in the world of Pandora, but once I did I couldn’t look away. I don’t see any way that this film doesn’t win Art Direction, Film Editing, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects. Its the other categories that I am not sure about. I really don’t want it to win best picture, Director, and Cinematography, but I could see some of them happening.

Final thought: Spectacularly beautiful film! Everyone should see this in 3D. Don’t wait for dvd!

### Julie & Julia

This was a very cute film. It really made me want to eat and cook delicious French foods! Meryl Streep was really great as Julia Child. Very convincing. I hope she wins Best Actress. She was much better than Sandra Bullock.

Final thought: Great film to watch at home with your family.

### The Blind Side

This film was very heart warming and inspirational. Sandra Bullock did a great job in her role as a wealthy suburban mother who takes in a homeless teenager and helps him go to college on a football scholarship. As a Best Picture nominee, I’m just not convinced. There were other films this year that could have been nominated over this.

Final thought: Great inspirational family film, not really worth the Oscar buzz, though.

### Precious

I can’t even tell you how heartbreaking this film is. Gabourey Sidibe plays Precious, a teen mom in the ghetto trying to make it through the worst possible situation. Monique, who plays Precious’ mother will win Best Supporting Actress, no doubt about that. You will hate her character, but her power is undeniable in the role. This could contend for Adapted Screeplay, but Best Picture and Director are a long-shot.

Final thought: Not a film for anyone who is not interested in very rough and horribly sad realism, but a must see otherwise.
