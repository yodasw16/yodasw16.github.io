I haven’t been able to make up my mind about whether or not I am upset about Rick Warren being selected to give the invocation at Obama’s inauguration. On one hand I am pissed that, at a time when thousands of gay Americans are protesting in the streets about the voters of California taking away their right to marry whomever they choose, Obama would ask a man who considers the crimes of incest, statutory rape, and polygamy equal to gay marriage.

On the other hand I think it is a non-issue. Warren is a man who has invited Obama, someone he disagrees with on gay marriage, abortion, stem cell research, and other issues to speak at his church. He is a man who believes we can work together on the issues we agree on without getting hung up on those we don’t. He has done some really great work on poverty and AIDS and believes that Christianity is about more than just those divisive issues. Of all the crazy right wing pastors out there, Rick Warren is at least willing to listen and work with those who hold opposing views. I mean, it’s not like he asked Dobson to speak!

That being said, there are a number of far better pastors out there who hold progressive views and probably should have been asked to speak over Warren. I understand all of the inclusiveness mumbo jumbo, but symbolically, asking someone with views as strong as Warren’s to take the stage with you on inauguration day is kind of a kick in the gut for the gay community.
