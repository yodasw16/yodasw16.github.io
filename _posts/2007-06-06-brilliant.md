My favorite part of the Republican debate was this (slightly shortened) response from Rep. Tom Tancredo to the question of how he would use George W. Bush in his administration:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>Some time ago, in 2003 I think it was, I got a call from Karl Rove who told me that because of my criticism of the President I should never darken the doorstep of the White House. I have been so disappointed in the President in so many ways actually in the last several years...that as President I would have to tell George W. Bush the same thing Karl Rove told me.</p>
