"US officials flunk test of American history, economics, civics"

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>US elected officials scored abysmally on a test measuring their civic knowledge, with an average grade of just 44 percent, the group that organized the exam said Thursday.</p>

        <p>Ordinary citizens did not fare much better, scoring just 49 percent correct on the 33 exam questions compiled by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI).</p>

You can [take the test yourself](http://www.isi.org/quiz.aspx?q=FE5C3B47-9675-41E0-9CF3-072BB31E2692) and see if you know more than the average elected official.

I took it: “You answered 33 out of 33 correctly — 100 %“
