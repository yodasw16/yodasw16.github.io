The documentary “Jesus Camp” really scares me. I have only seen the trailer, but I can’t believe some of the things that are being taught and said just in the trailer.

You can watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_yzUWIfzs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_yzUWIfzs)

Some notable quotes include:

    <blockquote>
        <p>There are 2 kinds of people in the world...people who love Jesus and people who don’t.</p>
    </blockquote>

Wow. Is that really teaching our kids to care about others? You’re with us or against us. Does the Gospel tell us that?

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>Where should we be putting our focus? I’ll tell you were our enemies are putting it. They’re putting it on the kids.</p>
    </blockquote>

She then goes on the make a comparison between what they are doing at these camps and arming and training kids to fight in battle.

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>At 5 I got saved because I just wanted more of life.</p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>
What 5 year old wants more out of life? When I was 5, more out of life was going outside and playing with my friends, not protesting abortion and fawning over a life-sized cardboard George W Bush.

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>I really feel that we are a key generation to Jesus coming back.</p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>
If we are going to teach our kids about Jesus, at least tell them the truth. This line is from what looks like an 11-12 year old boy. He thinks that his generation will “bring Jesus back.” !?!?!?

    <blockquote>
        <p>This means war, this means war, this means war!</p>
    </blockquote>

I don’t know, I guess that just scared me. 100’s of children screaming that. There is something wrong with that.
