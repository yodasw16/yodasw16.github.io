_This post originally had photos from the [World Can't Wait](http://www.worldcantwait.net/) protest on October 5th, 2006, but the photos were lost_

Gathering at Wayne State University at 12:30, getting ready to walk downtown at 2:30.

Walking to Grand Circus Park for the Rally at 4:30. We ended up with about 400 people.

We had a huge police escort as we walked. This guy on the bike kept threatening to arrest me because I wouldn’t stop walking in the street. I kept telling him that the streets belong to the people. And this guy next to me kept calling him a pig. He was getting really pissed! The cars in the 2nd pic were part of the “guard” at the park downtown.

Some awesome kids at the rally, some awesome people protesting torture on a pedestrian island of a busy corner by the park, and Rep. John Conyers who spoke at the end of the rally. The guy talking to him was wearing a t-shirt that said “Proud to be a Jew” and had a big Star of David on it. He was also handing out communist newspapers. I tried to take his picture, but my battery died right after this picture.

Amen brother, amen.
