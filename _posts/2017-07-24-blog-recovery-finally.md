I mentioned in [this post](/2013/12/07/a-simple-new-blog.html) that I would eventually move all of the old posts that I thought I had lost from my original blog to this one. Well, 4 years later I finally did it!

It was a pain in the ass, but there are now 63 posts dating back to [September 6, 2006](/2006/09/06/a-smart-president-who-wants-that.html). So, if you're in the mood for a bunch of posts about hating George W Bush, feel free to dig in!

If you really want to get weird, I restored all of the posts I could recover from my old Xanga blog into a wordpress site.

Have fun!
