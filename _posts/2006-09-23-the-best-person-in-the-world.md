I would like to nominate Sir Richard Branson as the “Best Person in the World.” In case you didn’t know, Branson is the head of Virgin Group and one of the most successful and adventurous business men in the world. He’s the guy that set the record for crossing the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle with the [Aquada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_Aquada), the guy that made the [swiss-cheese-looking spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne) that makes it out of the earths atmosphere, and now he’s the guy that has [pledged $3 BILLION(!!!!)](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/science/22warmcnd.html?ex=1316491200&en=282ea6fc58594550&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) to the development of energy sources that do not cause global warming. He is planning to give 100% of profits from his five airlines and his train line over the next 10 years.

He made the announcement at Bill Clinton’s Global Initiative Meeting in New York on the 21st. Branson credits the idea to a meeting he had with Al Gore a few months ago. Al Gore, it seems, really is [bringing the sexy back](/2006/09/06/a-smart-president-who-wants-that.html)!
