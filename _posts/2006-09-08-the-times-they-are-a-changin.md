Bob Dylan's new record “Modern Times” debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. This amazing feat makes Dylan the oldest artist to debut at #1, at 65 years of age.

Now, I know people love Bob Dylan, including myself, but this has to erase any suspicion that Bob Dylan may not be immortal. I would not be surprised if he never dies and just keeps making hit records forever. If anyone could do it, it would be Bob Dylan.
