Now it has all been made very clear. If you believe [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgz11BaF5uQ), gay marriage is absolutely HORRIFYING!!!!!!

Not only is there a storm-a-brewin’, but that storm will bring the gay…right…into…your…**LIFE**! Your freedom will be taken away (not sure how extending a human right to a marginalized part of society takes away my freedoms, but whatev)! Doctors will lose their **JOBS** (since they perform marriages? I don’t get it). Your youth group will be **DESTROYED** (no one is asking you to accept the gay into your church. The laws that have been passed specifically give exemptions to religious groups)! Your kids will be forced to **LEARN** about gay people in school (nonsense)!! They want to change the way **YOU** live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And you will have **NO CHOICE**!!!!!!! You will be forced to marry a gay person!!!! That must be what they are up to!!!!

At least [these guys](https://www.nationformarriage.org/) are forming a “rainbow coalition” who are “coming together in love” to save you! Thank God!!

What a load of bullshit that is.
