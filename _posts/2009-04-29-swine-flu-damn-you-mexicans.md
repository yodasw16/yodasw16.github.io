According to the [nuts on the right](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2009/04/27/paranoia-pandemic-conservative-media-baselessly/149558), like Glenn Beck, Michael Savage, Neal Boortz, Michelle Malkin, and pretty much everyone on Fox News, the outbreak of swine flu is the fault of illegal immigrants from Mexico!! Of course!! Don’t bother doing any research, why would you do that? It must be because of the brown people.

        <p>But if you are a family and you’re down in Mexico and you’re dying and those in America are not, why wouldn’t you flood this border? Why wouldn’t you come across this border? It’s exactly what I warned of — different scenario, different reason of — I was talking about economic collapse. People start to come and rush this border, then what happens? Gee, it would be nice if we had some border security?</p>

        <p>I’m going to have no contact anywhere with an illegal alien, and that starts in the restaurants. You want intelligence? Stop eating at restaurants where they have undocumented workers in the kitchen. You’re risking your life, moron. You want to be a good liberal? Go and have some wonderful food tonight and pay no attention to the kitchen. Go ahead, idiot. Go ahead, go and eat in a restaurant now with illegal aliens all over the kitchen and you don’t know if they were in Mexico yesterday or two days ago because your wonderful government doesn’t give a rat’s behind who’s in the kitchen or whether they wiped their behind with their hands.</p>

        <p>…what better way to sneak a virus into this country than give it to Mexicans? Right? I mean, one out of every 10 people born in Mexico is already living up here, and the rest are trying to get here. So you give — you give — you let this virus just spread in Mexico, where they don’t have a CDC.</p>

Turns out it wasn’t immigrants from Mexico who brought the Swine Flu to the US. It originated at St. Francis Preparatory in Queens when a group of students returned from Spring Break in Cancun with symptoms consistent with swine flu.

I guess I shouldn’t expect the wingnuts to do any research before bleating on about immigrants. This is exactly the kind of thing they are known for: using irrational fear to try and push their terrible ideas. Could they be more predictable? Good thing it doesn’t seem to be working anymore.
