I am really getting sick of the right wing spinning the sexual abuse of a minor into a big rant against homosexuality.

Former Congressman Mark Foley (R-FL) is involved in an internet sex scandal involving 15-16 year old congressional pages. The page program allows High School students to intern for Congress people and see how the government works. A series of emails between Foley and a 16 year old were released that showed Foley speaking inappropriately about another young boys body and requesting a picture of the page. This forced Foley to resign. Since then several others have come forward with emails and IM conversations asking them to measure their penises, to tell him about masturbation habits, sexual history, blowjobs from girlfriends, if they are getting horny, etc, etc, etc.

It has been a well known Washington secret that Foley is a closet homosexual. That, in and of itself is not a problem...other than maybe the fact that he is in a party who hates homosexuals, but that is another issue entirely. The issue here is that this bastard used his position as a Congressman to start sexually explicit internet relationships with children. Now you have the nut job right wing going off about homos!!!! What the hell is wrong with these people? This is a mental sickness. Having sex with children is a sickness, not a result of being a homosexual! Have a look at some of these morons below from Think Progress and other sources.

        <p>On the one hand, we have a poor misguided Republican man who had a romantic thing for young boys. He sent them suggestive e-mail. I agree, that’s not great...I hope it won’t come as a surprise to anyone that a big part of male homosexual behavior is interest in young boys.</p>

        <p>Open or suspected homosexuals should never be elected. The problem with homosexuals is that they frequently don’t have common sense and don’t acknowledge appropriate boundaries. Weird sex, public displays of "affection" and nudity, and sex with youth are built into the "gay" sub-culture.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is that you would think the left — particularly the gay left — would be a bit more interested in not having 16 and 17 year old teenagers classified as young children for legal/sexual/political purposes. If that were the case, then a whole lot of dirty old men would need to be prosecuted for felonies when they pick up street hustlers.</p>

        <p>But in today’s politically correct culture, it’s easy to understand how senior Republicans might well have decided they had no grounds to doubt Mr. Foley merely because he was gay and a little too friendly in emails. Some of those liberals now shouting the loudest for Mr. Hastert’s head are the same voices who tell us that the larger society must be tolerant of private lifestyle choices, and certainly must never leap to conclusions about gay men and young boys.</p>

        <p>In fact, the entire scandal might have been avoided if Foley’s homosexuality had been exposed and confronted, rather than protected, over the last several years.</p>
