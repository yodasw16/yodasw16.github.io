I find it quite funny that Rush Limbaugh, who was at CPAC to receive the “Defender of the Constitution” Award actually managed to make two huge errors in “quoting” the “constitution.” See if you can spot the problems (trust me, it’s very obvious).

What Rush Said:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>We [conservatives] love and revere our founding documents, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. We believe that the preamble to the Constitution contains an inarguable truth that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, Liberty, Freedom. And the pursuit of happiness.</p>
    </blockquote>

What the Preamble to the Constitution says:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
    </blockquote>

Notice a slight difference? That’s right, what Rush quoted isn’t from the preamble, it’s from the Declaration of Independence!! And even if he simply misspoke and said preamble instead of Declaration of Independence, he still got it wrong! Here is what the Declaration really says:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
    </blockquote>

That’s right Rush, Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. No freedom in there.

Idiot.
